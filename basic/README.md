# First steps in Swift

The simple hello worlds is the same as in python

```
print("Hello World!")
```

But moving to variables and constants you observe the first differences - you need to declare them and their type first!

```
let answerToLifeTheUniverseAndEverything = 42
```

Constants are declared with `let` and variables with `var`.

There is so much left to learn ... But I got the prime number calculation going on the first day! Something I do since 1992.
